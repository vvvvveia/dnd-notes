    <h2>What is D&D?</h1>
        <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">Dungeons & Dragons</a> is a popular way to get gay nerds to process their bad family life and seduce monsters through vaguely fictionalized versions of themselves. Also you get to use magic sometimes.
        </p>
    <h2>How do you play D&D?</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/how-to-play">This is an introductory guide by the people who make the game</a>. Basically you create a character and go on adventures created for you by the Dungeon Master (DM) of your game, using luck, creative thinking, and the skills and abilities you selected when you created your character. The more experience you get doing this, the higher your level gets and the more skills and abilities your character has access to. Remember that the game is fictional and all just in good fun so <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazes_and_Monsters">don't jump off the twin towers like Tom Hanks</a>.
