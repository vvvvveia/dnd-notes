        Alumor casts <code>Beacon of Hope</code> and Malfendius summons Beter Barker to enter into the cultist circle to
        get a feel for what is happening. Beter sees the cult members in a circle doing a chant and all the shards have
        beams of energy going towards an axe in the center of the circle and flowing into Kirby. Kirby notices Beter and
        he walks over to him and swallows him alive.
    </p>
    <p>
        We see Ezekiel emerge riding a giant duck from the staircase followed by Tourna. For the first time in his life,
        Malfendius charges ahead first and try to use <code>Mass Suggestion</code> to get everybody to leave and stop. 3
        of the cultists start to walk away but Kirby decides to just kill everyone by absorbing them as all of the
        shards form togehter as a weapon that Kirby now wields. Everybody begins to start attacking.
    </p>
    <p>
        At one point, Malfendius asks Kirby if he is going to be made into a major diety after summoning Dendar and he is
        like &ldquo;I am already a major diety&rdquo; and Malfendius responds &ldquo;That&rsquo;s crazy because I went to the
        far realm and nobody knew you&rdquo; then drops a star spawn on his head with <code>Summon Abherration</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The battle continues and everybody attacks Kirby until he is showing visual bruises from damage. He attempts to
        use <code>Sickening Radiance</code> on everybody but Malfendius uses <code>Counterspell</code> to save everybody
        from getting a ton of damage and the battle rages on.
    </p>
    <p>
        Eventually after everybody continues to get some good hits on Kirby, he moves across the area and does a move
        that gives basically everybody a ton of psychic damage and stuns everybody and then he disappears (but will be
        back in a minute). Kirby re-emerges from hell after gaining more damage from the lashes and flames and
        Malfendius and Luka attack him on arrival back on this plane which pisses him off. Tourna is attacked by Kirby
        and is unfortunately killed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alumor is able to finish Kirby off due to luck, she stabs him and divine light ripples through his body and he
        explodes.
