    <h1>2023-01-03</h1>
    <p>
        We catch up somebody we meet on the history of the necropolis, who tells us he came here searching for a scroll of ancient magic thousands of years ago but he got turned into a monster, and Malfendius holds up his scroll which agitates the guy who says that he&rsquo;s hangry after not eating for so long. Primrose discusses the merits of summoning the Terrasque with a scroll he found and having him eat Dendar, but we decide not to do that. Luke is able to discern that this guy wants power but that he isn&rsquo;t insane and wants to end the world.

        The guy shares that he was in the necropolis for a few hours before he was transformed. We find out his name is Dorothy and we try to gauge his usefulness to the party to decide whether we want to invite him to join our party. Luka looks around for the scroll Dorothy is looking for and she is able to find a scroll that summons a comet, which she pockets without telling anyone. Dorothy is able to find the Terrasque scroll but Luka swaps it for scroll of fireball, and Primrose convinces Dorothy to hand over the scroll which leaves him scroll-less and confused and we leave him at the tower.

        Primrose finds a scroll of how to summon Dendar. To raise him we get all the artifacts, take them to the place Dendar was slain, and then perform a blood ritual that is very extensive. We travel down the tower expecting to run into more monsters with a goal of going to a chamber where Dendar was slain. Primrose and Malfendius take some damage from some potions to refill spell slots and Eugene heals them. Everyone drinks some more and their spell slots are refilled but at the cost of some health. Everybody is concerned because Malfendius throws up blood after drinking a bunch and is disturbed by his tolerance. We hear drums and chants in another room and think that it is where the ritual is happening and are prepared to attack the cultists.

        Alumor accidentally calls Primrose &ldquo;Primnose&rdquo; by accident but then he takes a mask of his own face off and reveals that he had nose enhancement surgery and wants to be known as Primnose now moving forward as a tactic to scare the enemies. We attempt to sneak up on the cultists but Primnose knocks down a torch which echoes as it falls down the staircase, briefly pauing the chants and drums, which resume after a moment. Malfendius unsuccesfully attempts to disguise himself as one of the cultists and after being found out, the entire gang engages in combat with a couple guards standing guard outside the chamher. The group defeats the guards eventually, Alumor heals everyone that was damaged, and the gang prepares for the final showdown with the cultists.
