            The transforms back into their usual selves from being clams, takes
            a long rest, and levels up twice. The gang goes back to their base
            and is debating what to do next. Malfendius is drinking and everyoby
            is planning what to do next.
        </p>

            Luka, Malfendius, and Leor are calling Tourna on the Scrying Mirror
            to find out if she has any new intel. She reports that her dad took
            a trip to Icelandale with troops and is annoyed that the gang lost
            all of the artifacts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Leor starts singing a lyric poem about a hunter known for biding his
            time, Hunter Biden. Malfendius is looking around the kitchen for
            tomatoes to load into his eldritch blaster and shoot, which he
            shoots at Leor for their bad lyric poem.

            A shorter-than-usual halfling (The Librarian) knocks on the door of
            the base wearing a purple blindfold, we realize he is the warlock
            from the library. He is confrontational about how the gang fucked up
            and after arguing, we slam the door in his face. He continues to
            argue through the door and Luka, Primrose, and Malfendius
            aggressively argue with him and call him names. He apologizes and
            says that he is here to help, this is confirmed by Luka after an
            insight check. Malfendius realizes he is the equivalent of 15 human
            years old. He uses <code>Misty Step</code> to go through the door
            and aggressively proposes helping him out. Luka tries to use
            <code>Sleight of Hand</code> to steal his stuff but he catches Luka.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Primrose decides to refer to The Librarian as &quot;Pringles,
            Jr&quot; which pisses him off and everybody laughs at him for a
            while. He eventually decides to share that his name is Eugene
            Softfellow, which the gang makes fun of him for even more. Eugene
            was able to hold onto one of the artifacts from Volp initially, but
            he lost it and he has decided to help recover the artifacts more
            now. Eugene explains that he was working in the field and was
            promoted to middle management but was demoted due to losing the
            artifact and wants to recover it with the help of the gang.
        </p>

            Another knock happens on the door and an angelic voice asks if she
            can come in. It&#39;s the giant angel that we ran into earlier in
            the campaign. She glares at Eugene and is annoyed he&#39;s here. She
            is also happy that Alumor is a patron of Hoar The Doombringer, God
            of Vengence and Retribution.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Angel explains that Kirby is a primordial God who wishes to
            bring about all the planes of existence through the cult of Dendar
            and says that we have to work together.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everybody bickers even more and Malfendius shoots another tomato at
            Leor. The Angel threatens to kill herself and we all think this is
            funny. Primrose agrees to help out as long as the Angel and Eugene
            distribute bean monsters which they reluctantly agree to do in part
            of their respective realms. Luka wants to become the God of Murder
            but is turned down and the Angel proposes allowing Luka to induce
            fear in anybody within a 30 foot radius (a roll with disadvantage).
            Malfendius requests some beer and innate spellcasting abilities.
            Eugene gives Alumor heavy plate armour with +2 in addition to plate
            armor and resistance to fire damage after she asks for cool armor.
            Leor is given an accordian which gives +1 to any buffs used by
            Eugene.&#39;
        </p>
        <p>
            The Angel tells everyone to hold hands to teleport them to
            Icelandale. Luka realizes the holding hands isn&#39;t necessary so
            we all teleport even though not everyone is. We get to Icelandale
            and it&#39;s very cold. We look around Icelandale and notice 10
            different towns and it&#39;s not clear where the Dendar cult is
            located.
