            We arrive to Iceland Dale to frightful weather. Janet (the Angel)
            suggests splitting the party in order to cover more ground.
            Tourna&rsquo;s people are on their way to Iceland Dale. Luka grabs
            Malfendius&rsquo; mirror and calls Ezekiel to see if he can help out
            with scouting for the shards in the towns in Iceland Dale using
            giant birds but Ezekiel isn&rsquo;t able to do this, but instead he
            decides to start his way over to help out in-person.
        </p>
        <p>
            After Leor accidentally flirts with a child, Luka and Malfendius get
            on his broom and everyone else flies (due to Malfendius using magic)
            and we all arrive at Dougan&rsquo;s hole. Everybody gracefully flies
            except for Primrose who trips and is flopping through the air. They
            arrive at Dougan&rsquo;s Hole and begin asking questions to a local
            such as &ldquo;take us to Dougan&rdquo; and &ldquo;is this
            what&rsquo;s left of his hole&rdquo; but this leads nowhere and
            eventually they break off the conversation after finding out that
            there aren&rsquo;t any cultists around. Luka feels motivated to save
            the world so that the villagers and gang can attend FishFest 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
            Leor is able to use <code>Clairvoyance</code> to surveil a town and
            the gang considers doing this to make sure the towns are safe to
            land in. Malfendius writes in the sky &quot;Dendar sucks shit&quot;
            for any of the cultists but if you&rsquo;re not a cultist it just
            says something unnotable like &ldquo;hi&rdquo;.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next we all fly away for 30 minutes to travel to Good Mead. People
            are friendlier and there are more people around. We all go to the
            mead hall except for primrose who goes to look at the shrine of the
            flaming sword. The group enters the mead hall and note an ornate
            decorative flagon outdoors and a bee raising area. Luka questions a
            man named John Passerby about if there are any Snake Cultists around
            and he says there aren&rsquo;t, who then informs them that
            they&rsquo;re having a party with all-you-can-drink mead and
            Malfendius covers them. Primrose asks the shrine maiden about what
            the deal is with the flaming sword and the maiden says that the town
            founder carved it out with a flaming sword; primrose prays at the
            altar. Back at the hall, Malfendius is playing Edwards Flagonhands
            and Leor orders a (diluted) light mead after being turned down for
            an order of an IPA (Icewind Dale Pale Ale) after finding out
            it&rsquo;s out of season. Primrose invetigates the altar and
            doesn&rsquo;t find anything particularly useful and can&rsquo;t tell
            if the magic being used at the altar is anything but benign. They
            decide to leave.
        </p>
        <p>
            Luka steals the Mirror out of Malfendius&rsquo; pants and everybody
            sloppy drunk calls Ezekiel. Darkness has fallen over Good Mead and
            the group rests at a tavern in town. Luka remembers that she has the
            wand of locate creature and casts it to find her father and figure
            out the location of the cultists, and it reveals that he isn&rsquo;t
            in town. Luka starts drunkenly deliberating over killing her mom and
            Alumor suggests everybody go to bed instead of dwelling too much on
            their respective traumas. Malfendius doesn&rsquo;t sleep so he
            scowls on the porch. Luka questions Alumor about where the cult of
            dendar would perform a sacrifice and she remembers that it would
            probably around the mountain Kelvin&rsquo;s Cairn where the body of
            Dendar was buried after an ancient war.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everybody wakes up and we head towards the city Caer-Konig at the
            base of the Kelvin&rsquo;s Cairn mountain. Malfendius is rehydrating
            with holy water. We see Eugene as we arrive and he thinks its messed
            up Malfendius is drinking that in front of him. Eugene says that he
            figured out the cult&rsquo;s entrance is here and the gang is like
            yeah we figured that out. Primrose opens the door but Luka asks Leor
            to open the doors to the Ruined Caer and so Leor falls down and
            bonks their nose on the ground because they didn&rsquo;t know the
            doors were open. The floor moves in a trap door and Luka throws up;
            Leor pulls her hair back and Malfendius magically cleans up the
            vomit. The gang walks down the tunnel for several hours and we see a
            cavern with a strange disc-shaped city. Luka recognizes this as the
            fabled lost city of Necropolis that was home to an advanced
            civilization that practiced necromancy; it emanates a green-purple
            glow that sheds no warmth. Malfendius and Luka note that the
            necromantic energy of the place would be used for the resurrection
            of Dendar. Luka also recalls that there&rsquo;s a plague (Arcane
            Blight) that killed all of the original dwellers and Malfendius
            hesitates about entering the city. Malfendius recalls that Arcane
            Blight first causes paranoia and hallucinations, then clamminess and
            miopia, then eventually they turn into a monstrous, clammy creature
            incapable of complex thought.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eugene wants to go into the city and Malfendius resists it. Luka
            says fuck it and she walks into the city after everybody deliberated
            for a while about what to do next. Primrose, Leor, and Alumor also
            go in. Malfendius hangs outside the city, watching us and afraid. As
            we walk into the city, we notice two tall spires with gargoyles
            clinging to it. Primrose reads the rune on the spire and it turns
            out to be an Insanity Rune among many other runes. Luka checks of
            the Gargoyle is alive and finds that they can spring to life at any
            moment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Malfendius casts <code>Gaseous Form</code> and enters the city,
            slowly catching up to everyone. Leor and Primrose begins to feel
            paranoid, indicating the onset of Arcane Blight. Leor wants to go
            into the entrance of the insanity towers and Alumor suggests that we
            don&rsquo;t go into them and push into the city towards the Orb.
            Luke realizes that she can&rsquo;t rely on her friends to get
            through this and elects to sprint through the city; Malfendius hops
            on his broom and follows and Primrose tags along. Alumor and Eugene
            elect to stay behind and keep an eye on Leor.
        </p>
        <p>
            Running gang find a black obilesque with runes on them indicating
            the 8 schools of magic. Luka casts an apple towards the obilque to
            see what happens. Between the three at the obilesque, they all cast
            various schools of magic between them thinking that something would
            happen. Nothing happens.
        </p>
        <p>
            Spire gang see 7 imp-ish creatures appear before them and they are
            about to attack.
