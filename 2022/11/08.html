            <code>DM Note: Devan was actually himself but Kirby killed him and wore his skin like a mask</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            The gang starts fighting Kirby. They are able to eventually push him
            back into the circle and briefly paralyze him. Luka figures out that
            he is letting himself get paralyzed because he feels he can get out
            of the portal if he wanted to and he wants to trap us in it.
        </p>
        <p>
            He eventually <code>Misty Step</code>s out of it and becomes
            unparalyzed. The team continues to deal him damage, upsetting Kirby
            who decides to start attacking more offensively. The gang continues
            to attack him and eventually his body is literally falling apart, he
            appears to be a magical creature of some kind but we can&#39;t
            figure out what his deal is exactly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eventually he explodes into a pile of meat and fluids but it starts
            bubbling and a tentacle monster emerges as Kirby says
            &quot;you&#39;ve unlocked my second form&quot; to the anger of
            everybody. Kirby is able to succesfully use
            <code>Mental Prison</code> on Malfendius trapping him inside of a
            game of Bean Monsters. Eventually after damaging Tentacle Kirby
            more, Leor is able to use <code>Dispell Magic</code> to free him.
        </p>
        <p>
            Primrose uses <code>Summon Woodland Creatures</code> and summons
            Agdon Longscarf, who apparently haunted Primrose when he was younger
            (not elaborated further on?).
        </p>
        <p>
            Kirby casts <code>Mass Polymorph</code>, which affects everybody but
            Primrose. Everybody is transformed into a clam. Kirby forces all of
            the artifacts out of our bodies and forces them all to come to him,
            and he teleports away after saying &quot;see you guys up
            north&quot;.
