        The running gang returns from their puzzle not working and everybody kills the imps. After some debate we
        decide to move towards the center of the city and run into even more monsters.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are able to find an artifact in the orb at the center of this area that allows us all to teleport to the top
        of the tower. The go to the upper level of the tower and enter a room full of wizardly paraphernalia and a
        meaning sound coming from one area of the room in shadow. A split staircase leads to a sunken library that has a
        ladder to access books on the shelves. On the edge of the pit there are three shambling creatures that
        haven&rsquo; noticed the group yet.
    </p>
    <p>
        Malfendius talks to the shadow creature to try and communicate with it and it responds with a crackling sound.
        Luka does an arcana check and it reveals that the shadow creature is actually construct. Malfendius sends Beter
        out to the shadow construct and it&rsquo;s a bunch of monsters that is identified as a living demi-plane spell
        that has become self-aware and the only way to go through the area is to destroy the chamber. Luka decides to
        light 5 pounds of dynamite she had on hand and use <code>Mage Hand</code> to push it through the dimension,
        blowing up the chamber and collapsing the shadow. Now the group is exploring the level of the tower. We learn
        that the shamblers are people who have fully succumbed to the virus.
    </p>
    <p>
        Primrose decides to heal and restore the shambler who appears to be the most intelligent in order to help the
        group navigate the tower. The other two shamblers notice this and start moving towards the group. Malfendius
        uses <code>Twinned Spell</code> to target two creatures with the same spell and he casts a constitution
        <code>Hex</code> on one of them and then <code>Finger of Death</code> at both of them and it looks exactly like
        the &ldquo;You Should Kill Yourself Now&rdquo; meme, neither of them pass the constitution check and they both die
        and become zombies under Malfendius&rsquo; command.
