        We see the vultures open a portal similar to what Devon has open in the factory speaking Fiendish. Malfendius casts <code>Darkness</code> on the portal they are opening so it affects the lizards and Luka’s sister, which forces the lizards to stop doing the portal. Luka and Malfendius taunt Tourna for their badly planned escape plan and Luka reveals that she stole her mom’s weapons, which catches her by surprise and makes her more mad.
    </p>
    <p>
        The group enters combat at this point. One of the lizards casts <code>True Seeing</code> so that it can cast a portal through the <code>Darkness</code> Malfendius casted earlier. Tourna tries to hide but everyone can see her, Luka flies up to the ceiling and hides then shoots at her mom but dramatically misses revealing her location. Luka’s sister shoots her and says that the family has gone downhill because neither Luka or Tourna are sneaky.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the Vultures cast a spell, but Malfendius casted <code>Coutnerspell</code> to cancel it’s effects. The Vulture tries to counter this but fails comedically.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tourna tries to hide again and is unsuccesful for everyone but Malfendius, but she fails to succesfully shoot Malfendius and reveals her position dramatically. Luka summons John Golem who grapples her mom and then atttacks her.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the Vultures succesfully paralyzes everyone but Leor. Malfendius later becomes unparalyzed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tourna is damaged by the vultures and has decided to begin fighting on the gang’s side.
    </p>
    <p>
        Malfendius uses Mental Prisoner’s Hat on Luka’s mom while she is grappled, effectively rendering her useless until somebody can help her escape the grapple.
