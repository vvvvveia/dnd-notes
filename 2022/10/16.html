        A portal/door appears suddenly and Galeron steps through, saying that he was called for help and he unparalyzes Luka. One of the vultures shoots Galeron with <code>Ray of Enfeeblement</code> but Luka uses <code>Silvery Barbs</code> and it no longer is able to effectively hit Galerson. Leor dispels magic on Alumor, now making the entire party no longer paralyzed.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the vultures is about to kill Tourna, but Malfendius decides to use <code>Counterspell</code> and save her life.
    </p>
    <pre>    Note from DM:
John Golem is, in fact, an Elemental and not a Golem.</pre>
    <p>
        Galeron casts <code>Magic Circle</code> and names the targets within the circle as Fiends, which is assumed based on the fact that the vultures were speaking Fiendish earlier in the level. He is able to effect one of the Fiends/Vultures, effectively trapping one of them in the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
        The group continues to damage the Fiend that isn’t trapped and eventually kills him, leaving only Luka’s mom and the trapped Fiend remaining. The Fiend brings out a scrying mirror and speaks into the mirror in Fiendish, and then  casts <code>Feeble Mind</code> on Luka’s mom and is killed moments later, rendering her not useful to the group.
    </p>
    <p>
        While searching the body of the Fiend who used the scrying mirror, we find the shard in his posession. Malfendius gets ahold of the shard and it pulses with energy.
    </p>
    <p>
        The group is unsure what to do with Luka’s mom because her current state cannot be simply resolved by using <code>Dispel Magic</code>, and Luka only wants to kill her mom at a time where she can know that Luka is the one intentionally doing it. We decide to take Luka’s mom with us with the intention to cure her condition with the help of a Cleric or another magical person at a later time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Luka opens a casket in the room where we all fought and she finds her grandmother’s skeleton in the casket. Luka says “God bless her soul” and takes all the treasure in the casket, equaling about 5,000 Gold Pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
        While investingating the scrying mirror, we see that it is set to contact a carnival tent and the entire group minus Galeron mutters in unison “Kirby”.
    </p>
    <p>
        Leor and Malfendius loot the castle as well, and they leave some of the money in Primrose’s pocket who has mysteriously been asleep or unconscious since Galeron appeared. Afert all of this, Galeron decides to leave now that the battle is over and the group goes back to the factory/casino to take a long rest.
