        Primrose awkens, thanking the team for giving him money. He decides
        to turn to turn the hat inside-out with the goal of creating a
        dimension of good things rather than a dimension of nightmares but
        he fails to do this and gives up.
    </p>
    <p>
        Luka reports that Ratatat and the Duck have died in battle, Tony and
        Griz start to tear up at this news. Primrose says &quot;there&#39;s
        plenty of ratmen out there in this big, wide world&quot; and
        everybody chastises him.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>Meta note: Junie notes that Primrose looks startingly like communismkills.</code

    </p>
    <p>
        The henchmen bring up that they were promised gold for helping with
        the seige. Luka deceives the gang into accepting 200 gold for doing
        this, giving 800 to the remaining character.
    </p>
    <p>
        The gang debates partying but decides not to. Luka asks Devon about
        how to break <code>Feeble Mind</code> and Primrose reveals that he
        has the spell <code>Heal</code> which can be used to bring
        Luka&#39;s mom to sentience. Malfendius, Primrose, and Luka debate
        where to contain Luka&#39;s mom after she comes to and decides to
        use the bone cage skeleton that was previously used for strippers.
        To distract Primrose, Luka gives him a list of ingredients for
        lasgana, and he gives it to Bartholomew for him to find. To prevent
        Luka&#39;s mom from using spells, we bind her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are reminded that Tourna is staying back at the castle gathering
        intel for us and can contact us as-needed through a scrying mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now that Luka&#39;s mom is bound and contained, Primrose uses
        <code>Heal</code> to restore her brain capacities. She awakes
        confused and disoriented, and Malfendius hexes her immediately and
        begins interrogating her, which she cannot not answer due to
        <code>Mass Suggestion</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        She says that they are a cult of Dendar, putting together all the
        pieces of the weapon used to destroy him in order to resurrect him.
        The shards cannot be destroyed in his dimension/plane. Luka&#39;s
        mom tells the group that the &quot;fiends&quot; are actually
        humanoid characters tortured by gods to the point that they&#39;re
        very fucked up (this is despite them speaking fiendish and being
        affected by spells specifically targetting fiends). The gang has 7,
        the cult of Dendar has 4, and Volp has 1 of the shards at this point
        and Luka&#39;s mom doesn&#39;t have one of them. Luka&#39;s mom
        gives sass about not answering anybody but Malfendius&#39;
        questions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The cult has the remainding shards in Icelandale, in the sunken city
        of Acropolis. Primrose suggests hiding the remaining shards in
        various places underground or under the ocean, and Luka&#39;s mom
        replies &quot;it&#39;s a good thing that no creatures can swim&quot;
        and everone laughs or at least snickers at this. Luka takes Devon
        aside and asks about potentially preventing Dendar from scattering
        the pieces to begin with by going back in time, but we decide this
        isn&#39;t ultimately productive so we instead decide to just kill
        everybody in posession of the shards.
    </p>
    <p>
        Luka&#39;s mom reveals that her husband/Luka&#39;s dad is involved
        with this scheme and he is in Balder&#39;s Gate. Luka&#39;s mom
        tries to recruit Primrose into the cult of Dendar because he would
        be treated better there but Malfendius tells her to stop and she has
        to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
        Luka asks her mom why she wants to resurrect Dendar and she says
        that Dendar is going to kill all the astral Gods and make the cult
        leaders new Gods in the new world. Primrose says that she is stupid
        and everybody laughs at her but she decides that she is done being
        interviewed and disappears suddenly but Malfendius casts
        <code>Counterspell</code> and she is forced back into the cage after
        a failed attempt to cast <code>Misty Step</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Luka asks if anybody has anything she wants from her mom before she
        dies. She tries to <code>Misty Step</code> away and is
        <code>Counterspelled</code> again, and then Luka stabs her to death
        in the bone cage. Primrose loots her body and puts on earrings that
        make him sound like Lois from Family Guy but Malfendius rips them
        off. Luka burns the body.
    </p>
    <p>
        The gang tries to plan what to do next. Luka decides to lie to Doug
        about their mom being sent to work on a farm.
    </p>
    <p>
        Devan says can create a temporary portal to Icelandale as needed.
        Malfendius decides to call Volp on the magic mirror to contact him
        about the situation that&#39;s going on, but Volp is screening his
        calls and he doesn&#39;t answer. Primrose makes a bean monsters card
        for Devan. We decide to go to Icelandale to find the holders of the
        remaining shards and fight them. Devan receives a scrying mirror for
        us to contact him as needed. Primrose un-curses the Lois Griffin
        earring.
    </p>
    <p>
        The gang is strategizing how to approach this situation and decides
        who to recruit for the fight. We decide to bring along some of the
        Skeletons with us on our portal after taking a long rest.
    </p>
    <p>
        Devan creates the portal after the long rest and are about to enter
        into it. Luka determines something is up with Devan and it&#39;s not
        just simply a portal to Icelandale. Malfendius decides to send
        üÖ±Ô∏èeter üÖ±Ô∏èarker through the two-way portal in order to get a read
        about what happens. üÖ±Ô∏èeter is instantly paralyzed within the circle
        of the portal. Luka decides to shoot Devan, revealing half of his
        face gone and showing something else underneath. He takes off his
        entire disguise and Kirby emerges. Malfendius summons his slaad and
        proclaims &quot;we are going to beat you to death&quot;.
