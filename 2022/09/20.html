        <em>In the last session</em> we got a bunch of magical equipment, leveled up, and sent off our friend Jamie Jess to go hire some people to help us defend our newly acquired factory from Luka’s family who we are planning to wage war against.
    </p>
    <p>
        The gang meets back up with Jamie at the factory. Primrose is informed by Jamie that he found somebody to set up the teleportation circle named Devon the Time Wizard, a short and morose dwarf, because he is lonely and has nothing else going on. The gang debates the nature of time travel. At one point Leor interjects to say nonsense and Malfendius aggressively responds “Quiet, Leor, the adults are talking. Luka proposes paying Devon in freindship rather than money and Devon accepts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jamie brings in a werewolf holding two daggers named Tony, a were-rat named Ratatatat Man, a were-tiger also named Tony, and a were-bear named Griz. It’s the full moon so they are currently in their animal form.
    </p>
    <p>
        Primrose wants to unleash diseased rats on Luka’s family, Luka rolls insight on Ratatat Man to see what he thinks and he doesn’t think it’s a good idea but isn’t offended. DM clarifies that Ratatat Man does not view himself as a rat.
    </p>
    <p>
        Malfendius wants a plan to figure out what we are going to do and Luka proposes pointing the cannon at the door and shooting her family when they enter.
    </p>
    <p>
        The gang arranges the seige cannons on the roof of the factory and argue about whether butter is oil and roasts Leor about how they don’t know what the spell Mending is.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            “Anything can do anything, it’s just a game in our brains.”
        </p>
        <p>— Ava</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Jamie reports that Luka’s family appears to be bunkering down after scouting out their spot, not attempting to beseige the factory. Jamie also reports that there’s a lot of guards. Luka proposes giving them a parade float and Primrose suggests a wooden horse (or some other kind of wooden creature).
    </p>
    <p>
        Malfendius proposes planning. We all debate what to do. This goes on for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
        Eventually Luka decides to just go in and talk to her family, Malfendius will convince the guards not to bee guards, and the jocks will move the cannons outside and set up the seige.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jamie and the Furry Gang are down to help out with the seige in addition to the gang. Ezekiel sends us a giant duck that looks like this:
    </p>
    <img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/apps/440/icons/all_class_badge_bonusd_large.002a80f6485209eb207f71e7db0a27b98bbe521d.png" />
    <p>
        The jocks are able to carry the cannons after rolling well for strength. Luka is turned into gaseous form form by Malfendius for sneakiness to get into the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are a sizable number of guards in the castle. Malfendius casts <code>Guidance</code> as he approaches. He greets them and impersonates a guard union leader attempting to organize them around issues of workplace safety for Guardsmen, Gendarmes, and Sentries Local 45 (similar to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8InEAgkjAE0">this scene from Shrek 2</a>). Malfendius is succesfully both persuasive and deceptive. He uses <code>Mass Suggestion</code> to get the guards to meet at the union hall that evening, 5/7 fail.
    </p>
    <p>
        Luka is in her mom’s bedroom and sees her conversing with two lizard people, and the spell for her gas spell wears off. She hides and casts <code>Invisibility</code>, then listens.
    </p>
    <p>
        Luka’s mom appears to be strategizing with how to capture the gang and bind the crystals together in some kind of ritual, they have 4 of the crystals. The lizards look humanoid but with a fucked up lizard face, they appear to be unnatural in this form. Luka’s mom says that they should call a meeting for the whole counsel and the lizard
        people leave, with Luka’s mom sitting in the room alone.
    </p>
    <p>
        Luka pickpockets her mom’s crossbows for the hell of it and sneaks out, but not before moving the bookmark in her book to another location in the book to troll her.
    </p>
    <p>
        The gaurds are about to notice that we are going to initiate the seige but Malfendius casts <code>Enemies Abound</code> succesfully and we enter battle mode.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are basically slaughtering them. At one point Luka shoots a guard and DM reveals that that guard is named Gary and is a long-time friend of Luka who taught her how to shoow arrows, she saves him from dying. The gang realizes that our friends aren’t really helping out so Leor calls them all over in their free term and they begin storming the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
        Gary cannot decide whether to stand by Luka or her mom and throws himself into a catapult, damaging Leor, leaving Luka stunned. She says “Rest in peace, Gary”, breaks the catapult, and briefly stares at the sky. Everybody else continues to fight and succesfully kills all of the guards that are outside.
    </p>
    <p>
        The gang catches up with Luka and she updates them on the plan her mom was working on.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alumor raises concerns about drawing attention to the crew due to the noise of destroying castle walls with with
        seige cannons and the gang says it probably won’t be a problem because it’s a “cutthroat city,” but Malfendius
        casts <code>Silence</code> on one of the cannons to appease Alumor.
    </p>
    <p>
        The gang shoots 30 cannonballs at the castle and bascially fucks it up.
    </p>
    <p>
        We forgot that the duck was supposed to be here so it showed up a half hour late <del>with McDonalds</del> and asked if it missed anything.
    </p>
