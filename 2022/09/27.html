        After we knock down the gates, Ratatat man rides the duck and grabs the big cannon. Not everyone is able to fit through a hole in the wall, so the gang and the the duck (with Ratatat man) enter and the rest of the group enters into the main entrance. Malfendius gives Griz a magic mirror to communicate.
    </p>
    <p>
        The gang enters a room with 7 statues standing in front of 7 rooms. Leor examines the statues and notices the world ‚ÄúGuardian‚Äù in Elvish. The gang notices that there is guardian written on several other status and Malfendius casts <code>Identify</code> on the statue and it comes to life, revealing itself as a Gargoyle and the group enters combat.
    </p>
    <p>
        We realize partway through the fight that 3 of enemies are actually just animated suites of armor. The gargoyles and suits of armor fought well at first but they were quickly beaten by the group. At one pont Primrose used a fire attack and Malfendius appeared impressed, potentially for the first time this had happened. After wearing the enemies out over a short battle, Malfendius (in an incredible show of bloodlust) rapidly kills three of the remaining enemies and sits down because he is tired.
    </p>
    <p>
        Luka looks for traps in one of the rooms, the one blue on the southeast side. It is free of traps so she enters a room with only a rug. She looks under the door and finds a trapdoor that opens to a main hall. She goes to all of the other doors with rugs and finds trapdoors under all of them, each going to an unmarked tunnel. The Blue one on the southeast side is the only one that leads to anything recognizable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Luka remembers that the colors in the room correspond to specific passages, some of them important areas and some to dungeons, pits, or sacrificial chambers, and that her family changed the colors monthly so it is not known exactly which tunnel to choose. Primrose suggests checking the dining room in the middle of the room and finds find that there isn‚Äôt a trapdoor underneath, and feels silly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Luka decides to go down the green tunnel because she likes green. The group goes down a sliding tunnel and enters into a room with a huge monster with spikes all over that is covered in impaled corpses with an iron maiden, a cauldron, and a pile of bones. The monster is magical, but is also semi-mechanical. The sliding tunnel door shuts behind the group, leaving them trapped. Malfendius looks at the door and debates leaving the group but decies to stay and fight, and the group enters combat.
    </p>
    <p>
        Primrose attempts to cast <code>Disintegrate</code> and it does not succeed, which demoralizes the group because that was an extremely powerful spell that is now wasted. Leor attempts to <code>Polymorph</code> the monster into an oyster but is not succesful.
    </p>
    <p>
        Luka attempts to dip her arrows into the cauldron and finds that it is full of acid and burns the arrows. She floats above the cauldron taunting the monster to walk toward her and damage it with the acid, which aggrivates the monster. It comes over towards Luka and swings towards her, risking knocking her into the cauldron while it swings. Leor uses <code>Cutting Words</code> as a reaction, narrowly saving Luka from dying in acid. The cauldron is spilled, soaking the floor in acid and damaging the monster. It swings again and succesfully hits Luka, damaging her and knocking her into the acid as it is also damaged by the acid.
    </p>
    <p>
        The group takes turns fighting the monster. Malfendius contacts the group that was left behind using the magic mirror and and asks for support and they head over. The group continues to fight, doing a fair amount of damage, but the monster conjures spirits in response and the group is demoralized. Soon after, Alumor kills the monster but the spirits remain and Primrose and Malfendius debate leaving the spirits behind to haunt the dungeon forever but the group decides to kill the ghosts. Malfendius kills one of the spirits and majorly weakens one of them and Leor finishes the other off.
    </p>
    <p>
        The group escapes the area where they fought the monster while the other group lowers a rope. They get back to the main area with all the rooms and take a short rest to heal.
    </p>
    <p>
        While debating what to do next, Malfendius decides to summon üÖ±Ô∏èeter üÖ±Ô∏èarker to great acclaim from the group (except for the hired arms and Jamie, who are confused why we love this random spider so much). üÖ±Ô∏èeter is sent down the northeast Orange trap door and, miraculously, he lands on the floor of Luka‚Äôs Mom‚Äôs empty room. Malfendius instructs him to investigate the room for any kind of traps. üÖ±Ô∏èeter explodes while doing this. Primrose suggests that he could use <code>Summon Woodland Creatures</code> to act as tests for more traps.
    </p>
    <p>
        Malfendius remembers that he has the wand of locate creature, and hands it to Luka in order to find her mom. She finds that her mom is in the west blue tunnel and she immediately bolts that direction with the rest of the group running immediately behind. Luka and Malfendius both cast <code>Fly</code> while sliding down the tunnel.
    </p>
    <p>
        The group enters a small room with a lot of treasure and Luka‚Äôs mom, her sister, and two of the lizard people that were meeting with Luka‚Äôs mom previously. Malfendius says ‚ÄúWell‚Äîif it isn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ T‚Ä¶ To‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre not actually that memorable, I don‚Äôt remember your name‚Äù. She is offended by this and she asks Luka why her friend is mean.
